## TMDb API key

This project uses TMDb API v3. In order to enable proper usage of the API, an authorization key must be obtained (instructions here: https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started) and added to the strings.xml file as shown below:

```
<string name="tmdbApiKey">ADD YOUR API KEY HERE</string>
```
